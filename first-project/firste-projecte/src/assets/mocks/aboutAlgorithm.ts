export const aStarinfo = 'A* works by considering all the adjacent points around our starting point and computing a cost function(Which you can think of as time or distance) for each of the adjacent points. Since our goal in pathfinding is to find the path that requires the least cost, we will then explore the option that has the least cost, and repeat this process until we reach our end point. The cost value of a point is computed by adding the distance from that point to our starting point, to the distance from that point to the ending point. Note that since we are working over a grid, we are using what’s called the taxicab norm to measure distance(The sum of horizontal and vertical differences between the points). The way you choose to measure distance is going to depend on the problem you are working on'
